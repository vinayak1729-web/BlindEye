# BlindEye
 a groundbreaking IoT project for visually impaired individuals. The concept involves smart glasses equipped with a camera connected to a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. A machine learning algorithm processes real-time video to identify objects and obstacles. An integrated voice assistant provides navigation instructions, and motion sensors on the back trigger a subtle shock for danger detection. The user can toggle shock modes, and device status is accessible through a mobile app connected via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This innovative solution aims to enhance mobility and safety for the visually impaired.
